* lessons learned? What can I say to other max developers?
  * Importance of Threading(!)
    * Max is primarily a realtime programming environment. So non-realtime generates some issues.
  * Creating/Establishing feature limitations early on. Can easily get huge.
  * Utilize tabs and the Menubar for effective use of space!

  * Store settings is useful

* Working collaboratively with MaxMSP on GitHub
  * Abstractions
